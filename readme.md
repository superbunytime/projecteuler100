projecteuler.net

I'm going through problems on project euler to broaden my logic; this public repository serves as testimony that I can, in fact, write code (sometimes).

Per the spirit of PE, if you're here looking for solutions, turn back; the joy is in discovery, or so they say.

If I even make it that far, this repository will only contain the first 100 challenges; anything beyond that will be put into a separate, private repository to avoid violating PE TOS.
